                <h3>My Career Story</h3>
                <p>
                   My early career path led me to multiple administrative roles in non-profit service organizations. The environment was meaningful but the work lacked challenge.
                   I returned to school and obtained a degree in CS and shifted into an IT career path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the work was challenging but the environment lacked heart and it wasn't the perfect fit I had expected it to be. I advanced through various support roles and
                    developed some skills in systems administration but remained unfulfilled. I was mystifyed. As a geek who loves technology, why wouldn't this be the perfect fit?
                </p>
                <p>
                   Fast forward to the longest year. After some reflection I have realized that I need a new path. 
                   I don't get to use code in my current roles beyond a bit of script doctoring. Although I enjoy helping others, my creative side is relatively untapped.  
                   I decided to jump into the UW Web Development Boot Camp to see where learning to code can take me. My hope is to apply these skills to open source projects.
                   While I have participated in the OS sphere at the community level, I have not contributed any code. I would be thrilled to eventually learn enough to make real
                   concrete contribution to the OS ecosphere. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Ultimately I would like to create my own open source project to create online opportunities for a new kind of spiritual experience to folks who have not
                   found a match in currently established faith communities, but that feels like it is a long way off. 
                   For today, I am grateful to be learning new skills that expand my career options in new and exciting ways.
